# Starlink Watch

A Python tool that tracks the Starlink constellation in near-real-time and applies
cybersecurity-style anomaly detection to spot conjunctions, unannounced maneuvers,
suspicious proximity events, and orbital decay.

**Status:** Phases 1 (foundation), 2 (visualization), and 2.5 (live modes — dashboard, terminal stream, scheduled updates) complete. Phase 3 (anomaly detection) is next. See [notes/07-status.md](notes/07-status.md) for the running log.

## Live demo

Once `spacetrack update` has been run at least once and the dashboard is
launched with `spacetrack dashboard`, the web UI is available at:

**[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)**

(localhost — only reachable from this machine while the dashboard process is
running. Stop it with Ctrl+C in the terminal that started it.)

## Quickstart

```powershell
# from the project root, with the venv activated:
spacetrack update                    # pull 10,315 live Starlink TLEs
spacetrack stats                     # see what's stored
spacetrack where STARLINK-1008       # current position of one sat
spacetrack globe --open              # render the whole constellation in 3D
spacetrack track STARLINK-1008 --open   # ground track over the next 2 orbits
spacetrack observe STARLINK-1008 --open # sky view + elevation timeline from Colorado Springs
spacetrack live STARLINK-1008           # continuous terminal stream of position
spacetrack dashboard                    # launch Streamlit web dashboard at localhost:8501
```

## The pitch

Most "satellite tracker" projects stop at "show pretty 3D globe." This one borrows
the playbook of Space Domain Awareness (SDA) — the discipline used by orgs like
LeoLabs, Slingshot, and US Space Force — and asks the harder question:

> Out of 6,500 Starlink satellites, which ones are doing something they shouldn't be?

By focusing on a single homogeneous constellation, "normal" is well-defined, and
deviations become tractable to detect with public data alone.

## Goals

1. Pull live Starlink TLE data from CelesTrak (no API key, no hardware).
2. Propagate orbits with SGP4 and answer "where is X right now / when does it pass overhead?"
3. Store TLE history over time so we can diff orbital elements and detect maneuvers.
4. Run four anomaly detectors:
   - Conjunctions (close approaches with non-Starlink objects)
   - Maneuver detection (unannounced burns)
   - Proximity / inspector-style events (one sat closing on another)
   - Decay / re-entry tracking
5. CLI first; Streamlit dashboard as a Phase 4 add-on.

## Non-goals (for now)

- Live SDR signal capture (no hardware).
- Spoofing / jamming detection (different project, would need RF data).
- Tracking the full ~10k object public catalog (Starlink-only keeps scope tight).
